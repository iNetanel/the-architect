## Why This Exists

AI coding agents are powerful. But left alone, they drift — they lose context, repeat mistakes, hallucinate completion, and have no memory of what they did yesterday.

**The Architect solves the orchestration problem, not the coding problem.**

It wraps your agentic AI coding tool and adds everything it lacks out of the box:

| Without The Architect | With The Architect |
|---|---|
| You manage the task list manually | Tasks planned automatically from your goal |
| Agent loses context between sessions | Persistent memory via `ARCHITECT.md` |
| No recovery when agent gets stuck | Circuit breaker + smart retry + model fallback |
| You babysit every run | Fully unattended — fire and forget |
| No audit trail of what changed | Build counter tracks every agent operation |
| Agent hallucinates completion | Multi-signal completion detection |
| You re-explain the project every time | Project structure auto-detected and injected |
| One shot — no quality gate | Retrospective reviewer creates fix-up tasks |
| Developer plans every task manually | AI planner decomposes the goal autonomously |

The agent does the coding. The Architect makes sure it actually finishes.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+ and at least one supported agentic AI coding tool installed and configured.

```bash
# Install
pip install the-architect

# Go to your project
cd your-project

# Start The Architect
architect
```

On a fresh project, `architect` opens the configure flow and starts planning.

If pending tasks already exist, `architect` resumes and continues executing them.

If all tasks are complete, The Architect shows the menu unless you explicitly start a new plan with `--plan`.

### Common flows

```bash
# Fresh planning flow or resume pending tasks
architect

# Force a new plan sequence
architect --plan

# Force a new plan with a specific goal
architect --plan --goal "add Stripe payment integration"

# Headless / CI mode
architect --headless --goal "fix mypy errors" --scope simple
```

That is it. The Architect plans, executes, retries, reviews, and reports — unattended.

---

## Supported Providers

The Architect works with agentic AI coding CLIs. Currently supported:

| Provider | Install |
|---|---|
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) | `brew install opencode` or `npm i -g opencode-ai` |
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |

More providers are planned. The Architect is designed to be provider-agnostic.

When both are installed, The Architect asks which to use. Set a preference in `architect.toml`:

```toml
[architect]
provider = "auto"         # detect and prompt if both present
# provider = "opencode"
# provider = "claude-code"
```

Or via environment variable: `ARCHITECT_PROVIDER=claude-code`

### Provider Feature Comparison

| Feature | OpenCode | Claude Code |
|---|---|---|
| Planning and execution | ✅ | ✅ |
| Retry and circuit breaker | ✅ | ✅ |
| Retrospective review | ✅ | ✅ |
| Token usage tracking | ✅ | ❌ plain text output |
| Free tier model rotation | ✅ via OpenRouter | ❌ |

  |  1. PLAN       Decomposes goal into numbered task files     |
  |                Detects repo type, languages, frameworks     |
  |                Injects persistent project intelligence      |
  |                                                             |
  |  2. EXECUTE    Runs each task via your AI coding tool       |
  |                Streams output live to terminal              |
  |                Tracks completion with 4 corroborating       |

  |  3. RECOVER    Circuit breaker catches stuck agents         |
  |                Retries with model fallbacks                 |

**The Architect never writes your application code.** Your AI coding tool does. The Architect makes sure it actually finishes.

## Key Features

### Autonomous Planning
The Architect decomposes your goal into numbered task files using an AI planner. You are no longer the one breaking down the work — describe the outcome, and the planner figures out the steps.

### Persistent Project Intelligence
`ARCHITECT.md` accumulates architectural decisions, known constraints, lessons learned, and best practices across every session. By your third run, The Architect knows your project as well as you do.

### Smart Retry and Circuit Breaker
Failed tasks are retried with model fallbacks. The circuit breaker detects when an agent is truly stuck — via no-progress detection, same-error fingerprinting, and token-decline signals — and either rotates models or rewrites the failing task entirely.

### Multi-Signal Completion Detection
No single signal is trusted. The Architect requires corroboration between promise tags, `PROGRESS.md` updates, exit codes, and output analysis before declaring a task done. Stuck agents that claim completion are caught automatically.

### Retrospective Review
After execution, a reviewer agent reads the actual code, runs your tests, and creates targeted fix-up tasks if quality issues are found. Clean builds skip the fix-up round automatically.

### Free Tier Rotation *(OpenCode + OpenRouter only)*
Automatically rotates through free OpenRouter models when rate limits hit — mid-stream, without restarting. Zero cost, zero interruption.

### Build Tracking
Every agent operation — reads, writes, renames, test runs — increments the build counter. Full traceability of effort across every session, not just version releases.

### Live tmux Dashboard
Split-pane terminal dashboard shows live agent output, task progress, circuit breaker state, token usage, and build number — all updating in real time.

## How The Architect Compares

The Architect and Ralph both help coding agents work more autonomously.

Ralph is closer to a persistent autonomous loop around Claude Code. The Architect goes further into planning, task orchestration, persistent project memory, retrospective review, and provider-agnostic execution.

### Environment Variables

All planning flags can be set via environment variables — useful for CI and headless runs:

| Variable | Equivalent Flag | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `ARCHITECT_HEADLESS` | `--headless` | `true` |
| `ARCHITECT_GOAL` | `--goal` | `"add dark mode"` |
| `ARCHITECT_SCOPE` | `--scope` | `standard` |
| `ARCHITECT_CONTEXT` | `--context` | `/path/to/spec.md` |
| `ARCHITECT_PROVIDER` | `--provider` | `claude-code` |
| `ARCHITECT_ARCHITECT_MODEL` | `--architect-model` | `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` |
| `ARCHITECT_EXECUTION_MODEL` | `--execution-model` | `openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-pro` |

---

## Context Injection

Point The Architect at any document and it will extract the goal and inject the content into planning:

```bash
# From a PRD
architect --plan --context PRD.md

# From a directory of design docs
architect --plan --context design/

# Multiple sources
architect --plan --context PRD.md --context design/ --context SPEC.md

# CI / headless — colon-separated on Unix
ARCHITECT_CONTEXT="/path/to/PRD.md:/path/to/design/" architect --plan --headless
```

Supported file types: `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.py`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.sql`, `.graphql`, and more.

---

## Configuration

Zero-config by default. Create `architect.toml` in your project root to customise:

```toml
[architect]
# Provider
provider = "auto"                    # "auto" | "opencode" | "claude-code"

# Retry
max_retries = 3
retry_pause = 30                     # seconds between retries
pause_between_tasks = 10
retry_model_2 = ""                   # fallback model for attempt 2
retry_model_3 = ""                   # fallback model for attempt 3
carry_context = true                 # inject previous attempt summary on retry
retry_prompt_mode = "focused"        # "focused" or "same"

# Retrospective
retrospective_rounds = 1             # 0 = disabled

# Modes
free_mode = false
persistent = false

# Circuit breaker
circuit_no_progress_threshold = 3
circuit_same_error_threshold = 3
circuit_token_decline_pct = 60
circuit_cooldown_minutes = 30
circuit_enable_replan = true

# Cost control
cooldown_detection = true
token_budget_per_hour = 0            # 0 = unlimited
```

## Live Dashboard (tmux)

When tmux is installed, The Architect automatically opens a split-pane session:

|                                     |  BUILD                          |
|                                     |  v1.0.0 (build 10042)           |
+-------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
```

### Installing tmux

```bash
# macOS
brew install tmux

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install tmux

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S tmux

# Fedora
sudo dnf install tmux
```

### tmux Controls

```bash
# Detach from session (leaves it running in background)
Ctrl+B then D

# Reattach after detaching
tmux attach-session -t architect-<your-project-name>

# List all Architect sessions
tmux ls | grep architect
```

No tmux? No problem — The Architect runs fine without it. Same live output, no side dashboard.

Disable the dashboard entirely:

```bash
architect --no-monitor
```

`ARCHITECT.md` is worth committing to git — it is your project's long-term memory and improves with every session.

## Versioning

The Architect uses a dual-track versioning scheme built for AI-assisted development:

```text
v1.0.0 (build 10042)
 ----    -----------
  |           |
  |           +-- Global build counter
  |               Increments with every agent operation
  |               (reads, writes, renames, test runs)
  |               Never resets across versions
  |               Always at least 5 digits
  |
  +------------ Semantic version
                Increments on human-tagged releases only
```

The build number is a continuous record of effort. By the time you ship a release, the build number reflects every single operation performed to get there — not just the release tag.

**Major version alignment:**

```text
v1.x.x   build 10000 onwards
v2.0.0   build 20000         (major version, build floor jumps)
v3.0.0   build 30000         (major version, build floor jumps)
```

---

## Error Handling

| Scenario | How it is handled |
|---|---|
| No provider installed | Detects and shows install instructions |
| Provider not configured | Shows setup guidance |
| Concurrent runs | Lock file prevents multiple instances |
| Stale lock file | Dead PID detected and removed automatically |
| Interrupted run | Ctrl+C triggers clean shutdown, lock released |
| Malformed PROGRESS.md | Safe defaults, never crashes |
| Agent stuck | Circuit breaker detects and recovers |
| Rate limit hit | Cooldown wait or free model rotation |
| All retries exhausted | Targeted task replan attempted |
